# Particles from a Later-Loading Pack

You want your weapon to show the `I_Fire_Blue` particle, but the particle system that defines it ships in a separate pack that loads after yours. Done naively, your item asset resolves before the particle exists.

## Goal

- Your item displays the `I_Fire_Blue` particle.
- The particle system itself lives in a different pack (`Riprod:Hexcode`) that loads after your item asset, defined at `Server/Particles/.../I_Fire_Blue.particlesystem`.
- The stock particles already on the item stay intact.

The key fact: particle systems are `.particlesystem` files and are NOT patchable. Patchly only patches `.json`. What you patch is the `.json` item asset that REFERENCES a particle by its `SystemId` string. The string is resolved against the registered particle systems at merge time.

## The Asset

`Server/Item/Items/Weapon/Sword/Template_Weapon_Sword.json`

}
```

`SystemId` is a string id. A stock system it names lives at `Server/Particles/.../Sword_Signature_Ready.particlesystem`; the one you want to add, `I_Fire_Blue`, lives at `Server/Particles/.../I_Fire_Blue.particlesystem` inside the `Riprod:Hexcode` pack.

## The patch

Goes at the item's path with `.json` swapped for `.patch`. Use `Particles+` to APPEND your reference into the existing condition's array instead of replacing the stock particles. `$Requires` keeps the reference out until `Riprod:Hexcode` is actually present.

```json
{
  "$Requires": "Riprod:Hexcode",
  "ItemAppearanceConditions": {
    "SignatureEnergy": [
      {
        "Particles+": [
          {
            "SystemId": "I_Fire_Blue",
            "TargetNodeName": "Handle",
            "TargetEntityPart": "PrimaryItem"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Adjust the condition key (`SignatureEnergy` here) and the entry shape to match the real asset you are patching. The point is the `+` suffix: it appends a reference without wiping what is already there.

## After

- The `SignatureEnergy` condition's `Particles` array now holds both the stock `Sword_Signature_Ready` entry AND your `I_Fire_Blue` entry.
- The stock particle survives because `Particles+` appends rather than replaces.
- The merged item is written after `Riprod:Hexcode` registers, so by the time the asset resolves, the `I_Fire_Blue` system already exists and the `SystemId` string resolves.

Why the load order works out: Patchly re-runs its merge on every `AssetPackRegisterEvent`. When `Riprod:Hexcode` registers, the merge re-runs and the merged item is (re)written with `I_Fire_Blue` present. `$Requires: "Riprod:Hexcode"` means the reference is skipped on any earlier pass when `Riprod:Hexcode` is not yet loaded, so you never write a dangling `SystemId`.

## Notes

- You CANNOT patch the `.particlesystem` file itself (yet). It is not JSON. If the particle system does not exist in any pack, ship its `.particlesystem` as a NORMAL full asset file in your pack. Patchly only wires the JSON reference to it.
- The same rule applies to models (`.blockymodel`), textures (`.png`), and lang (`.lang`): patch the JSON that REFERENCES the binary asset, never the binary asset. Ship those as normal full files.
- Use `Particles+`, not `Particles`, unless you genuinely intend to drop the stock particles. A bare `Particles` array REPLACES the whole array. See the [syntax reference](Introduction) for the append rules and [Removing Values](Removing-Values) for deletion.
- Use `$Requires` whenever your patch names an id that only exists once another pack is loaded. It guards against writing references the engine cannot resolve yet. Full meta-key reference is in the [syntax reference](Introduction).
