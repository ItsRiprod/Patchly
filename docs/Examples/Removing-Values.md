# Remove a Field or Recipe

A `null` value in a patch deletes the key it is set on from the merged asset.
This is how you strip a field you do not want, or make an item uncraftable by
removing its recipe. The two cases below are the common ones.

## Case A: remove a nested field

Drop the helmet's damage resistance entirely, while leaving everything else
intact.

### The Asset

  }
}
```

### The patch

`Server/Item/Items/Armor/Iron/Armor_Iron_Head.patch`:

```json
{
  "Armor": {
    "DamageResistance": null
  }
}
```

### After

- `Armor.DamageResistance` is gone. The merged helmet has no resistance block at
  all.
- `Armor.ArmorSlot`, `Armor.StatModifiers.Health`, and every other field
  survive, because `null` only deletes the one key it sits on.

## Case B: make an item uncraftable

Items carry a top-level `"Recipe"` object. Delete it and the item can no longer
be crafted.

### The patch

`Server/Item/Items/Armor/Iron/Armor_Iron_Head.patch`:

```json
{
  "Recipe": null
}
```

### After

- The `Recipe` key is gone, so there is no crafting entry for the helmet.
- Stats, model, and the rest of the item are untouched.

## Notes

- `null` deletes the WHOLE key it is set on. Set it as deep as the thing you
  want gone. Deleting `Armor.DamageResistance` removes only resistance; writing
  `"Armor": null` would wipe the entire armor block.
- You cannot remove a single array entry by index. Arrays replace by default, so
  to drop one element you restate the array with only the survivors. For
  example, if `StatModifiers.Health` had two entries and you wanted to keep just
  the first:

  ```json
  {
    "Armor": {
      "StatModifiers": {
        "Health": [
          { "Amount": 9, "CalculationType": "Additive" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  The written array fully replaces the original two-entry array. The `+` append
  suffix is the opposite tool; see the [syntax reference](Introduction).
- Hytale's own assets use `"$Comment"`. Any top-level `$`-key is stripped before
  merge and never written, so it is not a way to remove real fields. Only `null`
  deletes.
- If another pack also sets the same key, `$Priority` decides last-wins. See the
  [syntax reference](Introduction) and the [Pack Developers guide](Pack-Developers).
