# Put an Item Into a Category

Items carry a top-level `Categories` array of string ids that drives creative-library and inventory grouping. You want to add an existing item to a custom category without losing its stock memberships.

## Goal

- Make the vanilla iron sword ALSO appear under hexcode's staff category `Hexcode.Staves`, but only when the Hexcode mod is installed.
- Keep its stock `Items.Weapons` membership intact.

## The Asset

`Server/Item/Items/Weapon/Sword/Weapon_Sword_Iron.json` has no `Categories` of its own; it inherits `"Categories": [ "Items.Weapons" ]` from its parent `Template_Weapon_Sword`.

```json
{
  "Parent": "Template_Weapon_Sword", // Categories is inherited from here as ["Items.Weapons"]; the old way you must copy this whole file and restate it

        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "MaxDurability": 120,
  "DurabilityLossOnHit": 0.21
}
```

For context, the inherited value lives in the parent `Template_Weapon_Sword`:

```json
{
  "Categories": [ "Items.Weapons" ]
}
```

So the fully resolved `Weapon_Sword_Iron` has `"Categories": [ "Items.Weapons" ]`, even though that line lives in the parent, not the child.

## The patch

Path: `Server/Item/Items/Weapon/Sword/Weapon_Sword_Iron.patch`

```json
{
  "$Requires": "Riprod:Hexcode",
  "Categories+": [ "Hexcode.Staves" ]
}
```

## After

The merged item's `Categories` is:

```json
{
  "Categories": [ "Items.Weapons", "Hexcode.Staves" ]
}
```

- `Hexcode.Staves` was appended.
- `Items.Weapons` survived because `+` appends instead of replacing.
- The whole patch only applies when the `Riprod:Hexcode` mod is installed; without it, the patch is skipped and the sword keeps its stock `Categories`.

This works because Patchly merges your patch onto the FULLY RESOLVED base asset, with inheritance already applied. The inherited `Items.Weapons` entry is present at merge time even though it came from the parent file, so `Categories+` appends to it.

## Notes

- The `+` matters. A plain `Categories` key would REPLACE the array and drop `Items.Weapons`.
- `$Requires` gates the entire patch on another mod being present. `Riprod:Hexcode` is the hexcode spell-crafting mod, and `Hexcode.Staves` is the creative category its staff items use. Listing a vanilla sword there only makes sense when hexcode is installed, so gating avoids dangling references on servers that lack it.
- The category id must be registered somewhere (a creative tab / ItemCategory, or a bench category) for it to actually show up. This example is the ITEM side: it puts an item INTO a category. To DEFINE a new bench category, see [Bench-Category](Bench-Category).
- This is also a clean demonstration that Patchly patches the resolved asset, not the raw child file. See the syntax reference at [index](Introduction) for how `+` and array merging work.
