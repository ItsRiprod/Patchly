# Repoint an Interaction at Another Mod

You ship a normal sword. You want its right-click to open Hexcode's spell casting instead of the vanilla guard, but only when Hexcode is installed, and you want everything else about the sword left alone.

## Goal

- The sword stays a sword: same identity, same `Parent`, same `Primary` swing, same `Ability1` signature.
- Right-click (`Secondary`) opens Hexcode's casting interaction instead of the guard.
- Only happens when `Riprod:Hexcode` is installed.
- One slot changes. Nothing else.

`Interactions` is an object keyed by slot. Each value is the id of a root interaction asset. Hexcode ships its own roots, including `Hexstaff_Secondary`, the right-click that opens hex casting. To change just that one slot the old way, you had to ship and keep every other field above in sync forever.

## The patch

Put it next to the target, `.json` swapped for `.patch`:

```
Server/Item/Items/Weapon/Sword/Template_Weapon_Sword.patch
```

```json
{
  "$Requires": "Riprod:Hexcode",
  "Interactions": {
    "Secondary": "Hexstaff_Secondary"
  }
}
```

## After

Because `Interactions` is an object, the merge recurses into it and only the named key changes:

```json
{
  "Interactions": {
    "Primary": "Root_Weapon_Sword_Primary",
    "Secondary": "Hexstaff_Secondary",
    "Ability1": "Root_Weapon_Sword_Signature_Vortexstrike"
  }
}
```

- `Secondary` now resolves to Hexcode's `Hexstaff_Secondary`. Right-click opens casting.
- `Primary` stays `Root_Weapon_Sword_Primary`. The swing is unchanged.
- `Ability1` stays `Root_Weapon_Sword_Signature_Vortexstrike`. The signature is unchanged.

When Hexcode is absent, `$Requires` is not satisfied, Patchly skips the patch, and the sword keeps its guard.

## Notes

- `$Requires: "Riprod:Hexcode"` is not optional here. If you point a slot at an id that no installed pack provides, that slot breaks. Gating on the pack that ships the id guarantees the target exists before you reference it.
- This is the surgical opposite of the whole-template reparent in [Conditional-Override](Conditional-Override). There you swap `Parent` and null the local interactions so the new template owns the whole behavior set. Here you keep the item exactly as it is and retarget a single slot.
- Object keys merge; they do not replace. That is why naming only `Secondary` leaves `Primary` and `Ability1` intact. See [Removing-Values](Removing-Values) for how `null` would instead delete a slot.
